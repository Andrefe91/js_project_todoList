# js_project_todoList
Practicing Javascript with a (roll the drums!!) To-Do List, i suppose you cant really scape the classics

The project was an interesting use case of what i have learned thus far. Honestly, for how simple the application is,
actually was dificult as i have not yet seen asynchronous functions and tried to implement something like the partials
from Rails (hell can get cold first if i have to model HTML with just JavaScript insertions). I approximated the structure
of the app to a MVC but with some difficulties at first, later when architecture was set up development went pretty fast.

Learned a lot with this one.
